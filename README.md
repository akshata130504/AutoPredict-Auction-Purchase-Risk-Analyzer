# AutoPredict-Auction-Purchase-Risk-Analyzer


# 🚗 Smart Auction Risk Analyzer

A machine learning project that predicts whether a car purchased at auction is a **good buy** or a **potential risk (kick)** — helping dealerships make smarter, data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Purchasing used vehicles from auctions is a common practice among dealerships, but it comes with the **risk of "kicked" cars** — vehicles that turn out to be problematic and unsellable due to issues like:

- Tampered odometers 🕒  
- Mechanical defects 🔧  
- Missing or problematic vehicle titles 📄  
- Other hidden risks 🚫  

These vehicles can lead to **financial losses**, including repair costs, transportation fees, and poor resale value.

**🎯 Objective:**  
To build a predictive model using real-world auction data that classifies purchases as either a **Good Buy ✅** or a **Kick ❌**, helping auto dealers **minimize risk and maximize value**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- 📦 **Source:** Real-world auction data with over **150,000 vehicle entries**
- 🔢 **Features:** Make, Model, Year, Odometer Reading, Auction details, etc.
- 🏷️ **Target:** `IsBadBuy` (1 = Kick, 0 = Good Buy)
